Emerging Systems Architecture and Technology


    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Q) Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    In the GPIO Project I was tasked with simulating an IoT Thermostat. I was to use a Timer, Task scheduler,
    UART, Peripheral button interactions and LED indications, and implement state machines to control
    specified functionality.
    
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Q) What did you do particularly well?
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    The primary aspect I believe I did well was the overall code formatting and layout. Additionally, I
    believe I accomplished all requirements specified by the project documents. 
    
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Q) Where could you improve?
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Overall, I can improve in every aspect as I am still learning and gaining experience with different
    aspects of software development. Additionally, I need to improve in my understanding of embedded systems,
    however I believe this comes down to lack of experience.
    
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Q) What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    The most important tool I am adding is my experience. As to other resources, I am adding the understanding
    of embedded device capabilities and how to interpret the physical hardware into software interactable
    pieces.
    
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Q) What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    I would say my further experience in coding with common standards and proper practices.
    
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Q) How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    I ensured that I used best coding practices. I focused on ease of use, modularity, and scalability.
    Proper documentation and whitespacing along with best pactices in code layout.
